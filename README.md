## ✨ What is KyoLinks?

**KyoLinks** isn't just another link aggregator – it's your **digital identity hub** wrapped in a stunning glassmorphic design! 🎨

It centralizes all your important links in one beautiful, accessible place, KyoLinks combines modern web design with practical functionality. Whether you're a developer, creator, or professional, this platform showcases all your important links with style and flair.

### 🎯 Why KyoLinks Exists

In mid of August 2025, Linktree went completely inaccessible in India for a few days due to an unxplained outage. I  had an account on Linktree for like 6 months, but suddenly I couldn't access it anymore.
That incident made me realize - depending on a third-party service can be risky. So I thought: why not build my own link-in-bio alternative, something I fully control and customize however I like?

That's how KyoLinks was born 🖇️. Even  though Linktree is back now, KyoLinks gives me (and hopefully others) a reliable, personal,and customizable platform.
